This is similar to episodes that he's had ^in the past when he's had low blood sugar. His wife had difficulty ^getting him up out of bed due to leg weakness and discoordination. She ^gave him some orange juice and brought him into the ER for evaluation. ^He reports that over the past few days he has noted increased leg ^swelling, facial puffiness, and increased SOB. He has noted some PND and ^orthopnea. He has had some vague chest discomfort this morning, left ^anterior chest, which is now resolved. Otherwise, he reports that he's ^been doing reasonably well without episodes of hypoglycemia. He's not ^been experiencing chest pain. He generally eats no added salt diet. He's ^been taking his medications as prescribed, however, his wife questions ^this at times. ^ ^CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ^^Active Inpatient and Outpatient Medications (including Supplies): ^^     Outpatient Medications                                 Status ^========================================================================= ^1)   SIMVASTATIN 40MG TAB TAKE ONE TABLET BY BY MOUTH       ACTIVE ^       EVERY EVENING ^^ALLERGIES: Penicillins. ^ ^SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Timbuktu with his spouse of many ^years. He's longtime retired. He does not smoke or use tobacco products. ^He does not use alcohol. ^ ^PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1) Longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus with the ^following complications: nephropathy, severe neuropathy. 2) Recurrent ^osteomyelitis of the toes with amputations. 3) Coronary artery disease, ^status post CABG. 4) Chronic atrial fibrillation. 5) Chronic ^anticoagulation. 6) Hyperlipidemia. 7) Hypertension. 8) Chronic renal ^insufficiency. 9) Chronic anemia. 10) Diverticulosis. 11) History of ^congestive heart failure. ^ ^PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1) CABG. 2) Toe amputations as described above. ^ ^ROS: As reviewed in the HPI. ^ ^PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission B/P was 139/73, pulse 63, weight 182 ^lbs. (this was up about 7 pounds since last seen in the clinic two weeks ^ago). In general the patient appears an ill, weak, elderly appearing ^male in no acute distress. He is oriented and is able to give a good ^history. ^ ^Skin: Somewhat clammy without notable rash. ^ ^HEENT: Eyes: Sclerae anicteric. Oropharynx with moist mucous membranes. ^ ^Neck: Supple without palpable mass or adenopathy. ^ ^Lungs: Diminished throughout, particularly diminished in the bases ^bilaterally. There is dullness to percussion in both bases. I hear faint ^basilar rales, not prominent. ^ ^Heart: Distant, regular rate and rhythm with a 2 out of 6 systolic ^murmur heard loudest at the left upper sternal border. S1 is normal. S2 ^has a fixed split. I do not hear and S3 gallop. PMI is nondisplaced. ^ ^Abdomen: Nondistended with active bowel sounds. No focal mass or ^tenderness. No organomegaly. ^ ^GU/Rectal: Deferred. ^ ^Extremities: Cool. Feet are somewhat cyanotic.

Probable hypoglycemic reaction. ^               2. Worsening congestive failure. Recent echocardiogram ^                   revealed good LV function. There was also pulmonary ^                   hypertension. It does appear that there is a ^                        component of right heart failure and possibly ^                        diastolic dysfunction. ^               3. Chronic renal insufficiency. The patient has not ^                   tolerated ace inhibitors in the past. ^               4. Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.

She ^gave him some orange juice and brought him into the ER for evaluation. ^He reports that over the past few days he has noted increased leg ^swelling, facial puffiness, and increased SOB. He has noted some PND and ^orthopnea. He has had some vague chest discomfort this morning, left ^anterior chest, which is now resolved. Otherwise, he reports that he's ^been doing reasonably well without episodes of hypoglycemia. He's not ^been experiencing chest pain. He generally eats no added salt diet.

Has been using NPH and Regular ^insulin to maintain his blood sugars. States that he is deathly afraid of having ^a low blood sugar due to motor vehicle accident he was in several years ago. ^Reports that his blood sugar dropped too low which caused the accident. Since ^this point in time, he has been unwilling to let his blood sugars fall within a ^normal range, for fear of hypoglycemia. Also reports that he regulates his blood ^sugars with how he feels, rarely checking his blood sugar with a glucometer.^^Reports that he has been worked up extensively at hospital and was seeing an ^Endocrinologist at one time. Reports that he had some indications of kidney ^damage when first diagnosed. His urine microalbumin today is 100. His last ^hemoglobin A1C drawn at the end of December is 11.9. Reports that at one point, ^he was on Lantus which worked well and he did not worry about his blood sugars ^dropping too low. While using Lantus, he was able to get his hemoglobin A1C down ^to 7. His last CMP shows an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 168. He ^denies alcohol or drug use and is a non smoker. Reports he quit drinking 3 years ^ago. I have discussed with patient that it would be appropriate to do an SGGT ^and hepatic panel today. Patient also has a history of gastroparesis and ^impotence. Patient requests Nexium and Viagra, neither of which are covered ^under the Health Plan. ^^Patient reports that he was in a scooter accident one week ago, fell off his ^scooter, hit his head. Was not wearing a helmet. Reports that he did not go to ^the emergency room and had a headache for several days after this incident. ^Reports that an ambulance arrived at the scene and he was told he had a scalp ^laceration and to go into the emergency room. Patient did not comply. Reports ^that the headache has resolved. Denies any dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or other ^neurological abnormalities.^^PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD, WN. Slender, 52-year-old white male. VITAL SIGNS: ^Blood sugar 145, blood pressure 120/88, heart rate 104, respirations 16. ^Microalbumin 100. SKIN: There appears to be 2 skin lacerations on the left ^parietal region of the scalp, each approximately 1 inch long. No signs of ^infection. Wound is closed with new granulation tissue. Appears to be healing ^well. HEENT: Normocephalic. PERRLA. EOMI. TMs pearly gray with landmarks ^present. Nares patent. Throat with no redness or swelling. Nontender sinuses. ^NECK: Supple. Full ROM. No LAD. CARDIAC: RRR. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. ^RESPIRATORY: CTA. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender. No HSM and no masses. NEURO: ^Significant for lower extremity numbness throughout. Microfilament test shows ^more than 3 regions without sensation bilaterally. Bottoms of feet appear ^calloused and dry. Skin is intact. There is also a small contusion on right shin ^which appears to be healing, less than 1/2 inch in length and 1 cm in diameter. ^No signs of infection at this time and appears to be healing. Cranial nerves 2-^12 grossly nonfocal. Cerebellar function intact demonstrated through RAM. ^^ASSESSMENT: ^1. Diabetes mellitus, type 1, poorly controlled.^2. Significant diabetic neuropathy with positive microalbuminuria.^3. Scalp laceration, secondary to motor vehicle accident, symptoms resolving.^4. Elevated Alk Phos, etiology unclear.^^PLAN: ^1. Diabetes mellitus type 1: We will follow up the elevated alkaline phosphatase ^with an SGGT and a hepatic function panel. The positive microalbumin is 100 ^today. He will be placed on a low dose Ace Inhibitor. I will put in a Prior ^Authorization for Lantus. I have also asked the patient to keep a log of his ^blood sugars for 2 weeks. Patient agrees to this. We may need to put in a ^referral to Endocrinology to get him stabilized. Prescription given for Prilosec ^OTC for GERD symptoms. ^2. Followup scooter accident. Lacerations on scalp and shin appear to be ^healing. Discussed with patient if there are any signs of heat, swelling, ^infection to return to clinic. It is extremely important for him to watch these ^areas as he does not have feeling in the majority of his lower body. ^ ^/es/ ELSIE PROGRAMMER^MD^Signed: 11/30/2015 14:27~V_507_11643|20151130134712-0500|final|N|9990000413| LOCAL TITLE: OPHTHALMOLOGY NOTE                                 ^STANDARD TITLE: OPHTHALMOLOGY NOTE                              ^DATE OF NOTE: NOV 30, 2015@13:47     ENTRY DATE: NOV 30, 2015@13:47:12      ^      AUTHOR: PROVIDER,EIGHT       EXP COSIGNER:                           ^     URGENCY:                            STATUS: COMPLETED                     ^^Patient was last seen in this clinic June 3, 2013.^^REASON FOR VISIT:  The patient is a (52)-year-old male who is referred by Dr. ^Doe for evaluation of a choroidal nevus in the right eye.^^^PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, visual acuity is 20/40 in both eyes. Intraocular ^pressures are 18 in both eyes as well. Slit-lamp examination is remarkable for a ^very mild cataract in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination in the right ^eye reveals mild drusen in the posterior pole. In the far superior nasal ^periphery, there is a flat, pigmented lesion. This lesion could be either a ^choroidal nevus or congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. ^Dilated funduscopic examination in the left eye revealed a small, flat choroidal ^nevus just superior to the fovea and drusen within the posterior pole.^^IMPRESSION:^1.  Choroidal nevus versus congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment ^epithelium, right eye.^2.  Mild drusen, both eyes.^3.  Mild cataract, both eyes.^^^PLAN:  The lesion in the right eye is too far out to photograph today. It is ^flat and there is no lipofuscin and therefore I do not believe there is a ^significant risk for progression to choroidal melanoma. I did warn the patient ^of the possibility of progression of this nevus to melanoma and recommended ^followup on a yearly basis.^ ^/es/ EIGHT PROVIDER^MD^Signed: 11/30/2015 13:50~V_507_11638|20151110094002-0500|final|N|9990013622| LOCAL TITLE: NEUROLOGY NOTE                                     ^STANDARD TITLE: NEUROLOGY NOTE                                  ^DATE OF NOTE: NOV 10, 2015@09:39     ENTRY DATE: NOV 10, 2015@09:40:02      ^      AUTHOR: PROGRAMMER,ELSIE     EXP COSIGNER:                           ^     URGENCY:                            STATUS: COMPLETED                     ^^Allergies:Patient has answered NKA^^SocHx:^*Location/living situation: Good^*Employment: Full time^*Married/relationship: Married^*Children: 1^*Smokes: No^*Drinks EtOH: Socially^*Drug use: MJ/cocaine/heroine/ - no drugs^*opiates/BZD/hal: no^^^ROS:^*Constitutional:  appetite/weight/sleep,fatigue, fevers^*Skin/Breast:   Rashes/bumps, dry skin, breast lumps/redness, d/c^*HEENT:         Visual/hearings, lumps in neck^*Respiratory:   SOB, cough, hemoptysis, resp inf, night sweats^*Cardio:        Chest pain, palpitations, murmurs,^*GI:            Abdominal pain, heartburn, N/V/D/constipation, ? bowels^*GU:            Dysuria, urge, stress, , hematuria, vaginal d/c^*MSK:           Muscle pains, leg cramps, back pain, weakness^*Lymph/Heme:    Edema, anemia^*Neuro:         Tingling/numbness, muscle weakness^*Psych:         Depression, anxiety^*Endocrine:     Hot/cold sensitivity, unusual hunger/thirst, hair loss^^OBJECTIVE:^VS:T= HR= RR= BP= Pain=^^General:alert and oriented, pleasant, cooperative/uncooperative with interview, ^NAD/in distress^^HEENT: NCAT, TM clear/discharge, conjunctiva normal/injected, scleral icterus^^Fundoscopic exam: Sharp optic disks/fundal papilledema/hemorrhage^Neck: Supple, no LAD, no JVD, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly^Cardio: RRR, normal s1/s2, no M/G/R^Pulm: CTAB, no crackles/wheezing/rhonchi, chest is non-tender, normal ^diaphragmatic excursion^Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, + BS.^Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema^ ^/es/ ELSIE PROGRAMMER^MD^Signed: 11/30/2015 14:01~V_507_11637|20151110092051-0500|final|N|9990013622| LOCAL TITLE: CLINICAL WARNING                                   ^DATE OF NOTE: NOV 10, 2015@09:20     ENTRY DATE: NOV 10, 2015@09:20:51      ^      AUTHOR: PROGRAMMER,ELSIE     EXP COSIGNER:                           ^     URGENCY:                            STATUS: COMPLETED                     ^^Watch out for fainting spells when patient has low sugar below 50^ ^/es/ ELSIE PROGRAMMER^MD^Signed: 11/10/2015 09:21~V_507_11636|20151106170108-0500|final|N|9990013622| LOCAL TITLE: ADVANCE DIRECTIVE                                  ^DATE OF NOTE: NOV 06, 2015@17:00     ENTRY DATE: NOV 06, 2015@17:01:08      ^      AUTHOR: PROGRAMMER,ELSIE     EXP COSIGNER:                           ^     URGENCY:                            STATUS: COMPLETED                     ^^This is a new Advanced Directive for this patient.

Has been using NPH and Regular ^insulin to maintain his blood sugars. States that he is deathly afraid of having ^a low blood sugar due to motor vehicle accident he was in several years ago. ^Reports that his blood sugar dropped too low which caused the accident. Since ^this point in time, he has been unwilling to let his blood sugars fall within a ^normal range, for fear of hypoglycemia. Also reports that he regulates his blood ^sugars with how he feels, rarely checking his blood sugar with a glucometer.^^Reports that he has been worked up extensively at hospital and was seeing an ^Endocrinologist at one time. Reports that he had some indications of kidney ^damage when first diagnosed. His urine microalbumin today is 100. His last ^hemoglobin A1C drawn at the end of December is 11.9. Reports that at one point, ^he was on Lantus which worked well and he did not worry about his blood sugars ^dropping too low. While using Lantus, he was able to get his hemoglobin A1C down ^to 7. His last CMP shows an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 168. He ^denies alcohol or drug use and is a non smoker. Reports he quit drinking 3 years ^ago. I have discussed with patient that it would be appropriate to do an SGGT ^and hepatic panel today. Patient also has a history of gastroparesis and ^impotence. Patient requests Nexium and Viagra, neither of which are covered ^under the Health Plan. ^^Patient reports that he was in a scooter accident one week ago, fell off his ^scooter, hit his head. Was not wearing a helmet. Reports that he did not go to ^the emergency room and had a headache for several days after this incident. ^Reports that an ambulance arrived at the scene and he was told he had a scalp ^laceration and to go into the emergency room. Patient did not comply. Reports ^that the headache has resolved. Denies any dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or other ^neurological abnormalities.^^PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD, WN. Slender, 52-year-old white male. VITAL SIGNS: ^Blood sugar 145, blood pressure 120/88, heart rate 104, respirations 16. ^Microalbumin 100. SKIN: There appears to be 2 skin lacerations on the left ^parietal region of the scalp, each approximately 1 inch long. No signs of ^infection. Wound is closed with new granulation tissue. Appears to be healing ^well. HEENT: Normocephalic. PERRLA. EOMI. TMs pearly gray with landmarks ^present. Nares patent. Throat with no redness or swelling. Nontender sinuses. ^NECK: Supple. Full ROM. No LAD. CARDIAC: RRR. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. ^RESPIRATORY: CTA. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender. No HSM and no masses. NEURO: ^Significant for lower extremity numbness throughout. Microfilament test shows ^more than 3 regions without sensation bilaterally. Bottoms of feet appear ^calloused and dry. Skin is intact. There is also a small contusion on right shin ^which appears to be healing, less than 1/2 inch in length and 1 cm in diameter. ^No signs of infection at this time and appears to be healing. Cranial nerves 2-^12 grossly nonfocal. Cerebellar function intact demonstrated through RAM. ^^ASSESSMENT: ^1. Diabetes mellitus, type 1, poorly controlled.^2. Significant diabetic neuropathy with positive microalbuminuria.^3. Scalp laceration, secondary to motor vehicle accident, symptoms resolving.^4. Elevated Alk Phos, etiology unclear.^^PLAN: ^1. Diabetes mellitus type 1: We will follow up the elevated alkaline phosphatase ^with an SGGT and a hepatic function panel. The positive microalbumin is 100 ^today. He will be placed on a low dose Ace Inhibitor. I will put in a Prior ^Authorization for Lantus. I have also asked the patient to keep a log of his ^blood sugars for 2 weeks. Patient agrees to this. We may need to put in a ^referral to Endocrinology to get him stabilized. Prescription given for Prilosec ^OTC for GERD symptoms. ^2. Followup scooter accident. Lacerations on scalp and shin appear to be ^healing. Discussed with patient if there are any signs of heat, swelling, ^infection to return to clinic. It is extremely important for him to watch these ^areas as he does not have feeling in the majority of his lower body. ^ ^/es/ ELSIE PROGRAMMER^MD^Signed: 11/30/2015 14:27~V_507_11643|20151130134712-0500|final|N|9990000413| LOCAL TITLE: OPHTHALMOLOGY NOTE                                 ^STANDARD TITLE: OPHTHALMOLOGY NOTE                              ^DATE OF NOTE: NOV 30, 2015@13:47     ENTRY DATE: NOV 30, 2015@13:47:12      ^      AUTHOR: PROVIDER,EIGHT       EXP COSIGNER:                           ^     URGENCY:                            STATUS: COMPLETED                     ^^Patient was last seen in this clinic June 3, 2013.^^REASON FOR VISIT:  The patient is a (52)-year-old male who is referred by Dr. ^Doe for evaluation of a choroidal nevus in the right eye.^^^PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, visual acuity is 20/40 in both eyes. Intraocular ^pressures are 18 in both eyes as well. Slit-lamp examination is remarkable for a ^very mild cataract in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination in the right ^eye reveals mild drusen in the posterior pole. In the far superior nasal ^periphery, there is a flat, pigmented lesion. This lesion could be either a ^choroidal nevus or congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. ^Dilated funduscopic examination in the left eye revealed a small, flat choroidal ^nevus just superior to the fovea and drusen within the posterior pole.^^IMPRESSION:^1.  Choroidal nevus versus congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment ^epithelium, right eye.^2.  Mild drusen, both eyes.^3.
